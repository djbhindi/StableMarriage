StableMarriage
==============

Runs the propose-and-reject stable marriage algorithm.
Simply put both files (stableMarriage.py and marriageHandler.py) in the same folder, and run marriageHandler.

On mac osx, you will have to enter: "$ python3 marrigeHandler.py" in terminal to run.
Follow the instructions/examples to get a solution.

Support for women propose coming soon I guess, if anyone wants it.
